Learning GitHub

Hello everyone!

I have worked in organizations that used GitHub in the past, but I've never used it for documentation. In order to keep up with the latest technology, I am learning to use GitHub by transferring my writing samples future employers want to see into my GitHub account and thereby practicing GitHub.
